## About The Project
This was my first experience playing around with an Arduino board. I decided this would be a fun game to try making since my resources were fairly limited in terms of electronic components.
It was also the first time I used a breadboard or did anything related to circuits other than 10th grade classes so the circuit is a bit weird. 

![Here is a representation of it](https://github.com/MohammadNabin/Simon-Says-Game-With-Ardiuno/blob/main/Simon%20Says%20Game%20With%20Ardiuno/Resources/Front%20Side.jpg)

## The Game
The game is played just like the classic Simon Says game (1-player only), the CPU generates an increasingly longer random sequence and the player has to repeat it.
The player has 3 chances at failing.
